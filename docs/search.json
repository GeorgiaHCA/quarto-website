    "text": "Test your unique sensory profile here\n\n\nWhile we share many elements of our sensory processing with others, our sensory system and sensory perception is unique to us. For example, we may perceive more or less nuance than average with some of our senses, be more or less affected by sensory inputs, or be more or less able to perceive the extremes of sensory input. For instance, some people who have a limited use of a sensory system have incresed ability in others, and there brain can even change to reflect this (a process known as neuroplasticity). Autistic people are known, in general, to process sensory information differently to non-autistic people, and as we get older we are less able to hear higher pitched sounds.&lt;/p"

    "text": "You’ve probably heard of the 5 main senses: touch, vision, hearing, smell and taste, but there is a whole lot more complexity to the way we sense, perceive, and respond to the world around us and understand ourselves.\n\n\nAll these 5 senses are known as “exteroceptive”, because they help us to navigate the external world, but there are also “interoceptive” senses through which we can have knowledge of our own bodies. Exactly how many senses we have depends on who you ask - and scientists haven’t reached a consensus. The answer, though, is a lot more than five, and ranges from aronud 9 to up to 21! We also have a variety of sensations which are made by combining the information we receive from different sources. The picture is even more complex because they are often intertwined. For instance, flavour is experienced by combining information from our olfactory (smelling) sensory system and our gustatory (tasting) sensory system.\nIn simple terms, we can think of sensory perception as involving four main elements: we pick up some information from the world around us or our own bodies (a stimulus), using a sensing organ (a receptor). We then convey this information to the brain using our nerves (nervous sysetem), and finally we interpret that information using specific aspects of the brain (neural system). We’re then ready to act on the basis of what we’ve learned. Some sensory processes even bypass the brain and we have an immmediate, automatic response which are governed entirely by the nervous system - for instance when we pull or hand away from something incredibly hot or jump involuntraily when there is an unexpected loud sound.\nThe table below gives some examples of different human senses and how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\nStimulus\n\n\nSense\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nNervous system\n\n\nNeural system\n\n\n\n\npresence of light, wavelength (colour) and intensity (brightness)\n\n\ntemperature change\n\n\ngravity and acceleration\n\n\nchemical contact\n\n\ntissue or nerve damage\n\n\nchange in pace or regularity of heartbeat\n\n\nself-movement, exertion of force, body position\n\n\n\n\nvision\n\n\nthermoception\n\n\nbalance (equilibrioception)\n\n\ntaste (gustation)\n\n\npain (nociception)\n\n\ncardioception\n\n\nproprioception\n\n\n\n\nEyes\n\n\nSkin and eyes\n\n\nInner ear\n\n\nTate buds\n\n\nskin, internal surfaces, some inner organs\n\n\nheart\n\n\nmuscles, tendons, and joints\n\n\n\noptic nerve and optic tract\n\n\nSpinal nerves\n\n\nVestibulocochlear nerves\n\n\nFacial and Glossopharyngeal nerves\n\n\nNociception axions and spinal chord\n\n\nVagus nerve\n\n\nCentral nervous system\n\n\n\nVisual cortex\n\n\nSomatosensory cortex\n\n\nVestibular cortex\n\n\nGustatory cortex\n\n\nSchwann cells\n\n\nSomatosensory cortex\n\n\nSomatosensory cerebral cortex\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to learn about different senses"
