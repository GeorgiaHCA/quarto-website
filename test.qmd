<h2>Test your unique sensory profile here</h2>

<p>While we share many elements of our sensory processing with others, our sensory system and sensory perception is unique to us. For example, we may perceive more or less nuance than average with some of our senses, be more or less affected by sensory inputs, or be more or less able to perceive the extremes of sensory input. For instance, some people who have a limited use of a sensory system have incresed ability in others, and there brain can even change to reflect this (a process known as neuroplasticity). Autistic people are known, in general, to process sensory information differently to non-autistic people, and as we get older we are less able to hear higher pitched sounds.</p>
