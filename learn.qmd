<h2>You've probably heard of the 5 main senses: touch, vision, hearing, smell and taste, but there is a whole lot more complexity to the way we sense, perceive, and respond to the world around us and understand ourselves.</h2> 

<p>All these 5 senses are known as "exteroceptive", because they help us to navigate the external world, but there are also "interoceptive" senses through which we can have knowledge of our own bodies. Exactly how many senses we have depends on who you ask - and scientists haven't reached a consensus. The answer, though, is a lot more than five, and ranges from aronud 9 to up to 21! We also have a variety of sensations which are made by combining the information we receive from different sources. The picture is even more complex because they are often intertwined. For instance, flavour is experienced by combining information from our olfactory (smelling) sensory system and our gustatory (tasting) sensory system.

In simple terms, we can think of sensory perception as involving four main elements: we pick up some information from the world around us or our own bodies (a stimulus), using a sensing organ (a receptor). We then convey this information to the brain using our nerves (nervous sysetem), and finally we interpret that information using specific aspects of the brain (neural system). We're then ready to act on the basis of what we've learned. Some sensory processes even bypass the brain and we have an immmediate, automatic response which are governed entirely by the nervous system - for instance when we pull or hand away from something incredibly hot or jump involuntraily when there is an unexpected loud sound. 

The table below gives some examples of different human senses and how they work.</p>
